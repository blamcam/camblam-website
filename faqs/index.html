        <h2>How do I add LurkBait to my&nbsp;OBS?</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>Once LurkBait is open, it can be added to OBS via a <strong>Game Capture</strong> source with <span class="setting">Allow Transparency</span> turned on (recommended) or a <strong>Window Capture</strong> source with <span class="setting">Windows 10</span> capture method. See the video below for a tutorial on how to do both these options in OBS.</p>

        <h2>There's a black box around the LurkBait window, I can't seem to get transparency working.</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>Make sure you're using a <strong>Game Capture</strong> source with <span class="setting">Allow Transparency</span> turned on in the source settings (recommended) or a <strong>Window Capture</strong> source with <span class="setting">Windows 10</span> capture method set in the source settings. There's a video tutorial on this page on how to do this.</p>

        <h2>What can players do with&nbsp;gold?</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>Right now gold is purely a status symbol and defines the peckin' order on the leaderboards, but in a future update we intend to add a way for fishers to redeem their gold for cosmetics such as rods, lures, and bait. Keep an eye out for me details about this in the future!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="note grid-item">
        <h2>Can I use a different account to post messages to chat?</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>In the newest version, yes you can! Log in your secondary account from the LurkBait <span class="lb-button-settings"></span><strong>Settings</strong> menu.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="note grid-item">
        <h2>Where's the link to the overlay?</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>LurkBait is a desktop game, that you add to OBS as a capture source like you would any other game — however LurkBait is optimised with transparency, autohiding, and minimal performance impact to allow you to to keep LurkBait open while you play other games. Think of LurkBait as akin to Marbles on Stream and Placid Plastic Duck Simulator in the idea that it's a game that's open while your stream is running.</p>
        <p>If you're not sure how LurkBait works or you want to test the performance of LurkBait while playing other games, feel free the download the free demo from Steam.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="note grid-item">
        <h2>Do I need to launch LurkBait through Steam?</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>If for whatever reason you're having problems launching LurkBait through Steam — you can launch it manually by going to LurkBait in your library, clicking the ⚙️ icon, the clicking "Manage" then "Browse local files" and launching the LurkBait exe from there.</p>
        <p>This is a great option if you have a streaming PC thats different from your gaming PC and you can't launch steam games from two computers at once.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="note grid-item">
        <h2>Can I use LurkBait with a dual PC setup?</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>If you play games on a seperate PC from the one you stream on, you might encounter Steam preventing you from opening LurkBait — however you can launch it manually by going to LurkBait in your library, clicking the ⚙️ icon, the clicking "Manage" then "Browse local files" and launching the LurkBait exe from there.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="note grid-item">
        <h2>LurkBait won't go away!</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>The <span class="lb-button-autohide-on"></span><strong>Autohide</strong> button in the lower left corner of the window will turn on Autohide, which will transition the window in and out when needed.</p>

        <h2>LurkBait is chugging like&nbsp;crazy!</h2>

        <h2>Are custom catches included in the normal catch pool?</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>If <span class="setting disable">Custom only mode</span> is DISABLED in the LurkBait <span class="lb-button-settings"></span><strong>Settings</strong> panel (the default setting), custom catches will be included in amongst the regular catch pool. If <span class="setting">Custom only mode</span> is ENABLED, only the custom catches will be avaiable for players to catch (as long as you have 1 or more custom catches), no in-built catches will show up.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="note grid-item">
        <h2>Is there a limit to the number of custom catches I can add?</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h2>What size of image do you recommend for custom&nbsp;catches?</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>It's not a rule but I'd recommend a square transparent PNG or GIF with a maximum size around 1000x1000&nbsp;pixels. Images that are too large may slow down LurkBait.</p>

        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>If you use any other application to stream other than OBS, you unfortunately cannot use LurkBait. LurkBait currently does not work with streaming from the Twitch Mobile App, or directly from a GoPro.</p>

        <p>If for whatever reason LurkBait misses someones chance to fish, the broadcaster and mods (if the <span class="setting">Allow mods to target cast</span> option is enabled) can use <span class="chat">!fish @username</span> to trigger the cast manually.

<p>Here are some other inbuild chat commands you can use.</p>
<p>The broadcaster account and the chatbot account are always superusers. Mods can be superusers be enabling
the <span class="setting">Mods are superusers</span> option.</p>
<div class="commands-list">

<p>Queues up cast for username. Broadcaster only unless mods enabled</p>
